{-| This script builds any version of the Elm Platform from source.
Before you use it, make sure you have the Haskell Platform with a recent
version of cabal.

To install a released version of Elm, run something like this:

    runhaskell BuildFromSource.hs 0.15

Whatever directory you run this in, you will now have a new directory for the
Elm Platform, like this:

    Elm-Platform/0.15/
        bin/             -- all the relevant executables
        elm-make/        -- git repo for the build tool, ready to edit
        elm-repl/        -- git repo for the REPL, ready to edit
        ...

All of the executables you need are in bin/ so add
wherever/Elm-Platform/0.15/bin to your PATH to use them from anywhere.

You can build many versions of the Elm Platform, so it is possible to have
Elm-Platform/0.15/ and Elm-Platform/0.12.3/ with no problems. It is up to you
to manage your PATH variable or symlinks though.

To get set up with the master branch of all Elm Platform projects, run this:

    runhaskell BuildFromSource.hs master

From there you can start developing on any of the projects, switching branches
and testing interactions between projects.
